Hello! 👋🏻 I'm Federico, a Full Stack developer by profession, with a creative and analytical mind that, along with my detailed nature, leads me to especially enjoy frontend design and development.

After two years of self-study 📚 a diploma and several setbacks in the world of programming, I found Henry Bootcamp, where I was able to take my growth to the next level: I learned the main technologies used in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, NodeJS, Express, SQL, Sequelize, among others) creating several projects from scratch. In addition, I met and developed a new facet of my soft skills by working and collaborating with my peers in group work and projects.

My curiosity knows no bounds, and anywhere I find challenges and possibilities to grow professionally and personally is a place I want to explore.
